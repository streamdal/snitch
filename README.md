**This is the _main_ repo for the [Streamdal](https://streamdal.com) project.**

Streamdal is a combination of open source services and SDKs that enable _real-time_:

* _Data observability (think `tail -f` for your data!)_
* _Data governance & enforcement_
* _Data quality monitoring_
* _Data transformation + obfuscation + masking + stripping_

.. and [a bunch of other things](https://docs.streamdal.com).

# Live Demo

You don't have to install the [server](https://github.com/streamdal/server), 
the [console](https://github.com/streamdal/console)
or [instrument](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/guides/instrumentation/) any of your apps to see 
Streamdal in action. We've got a live demo :)

### [DEMO.STREAMDAL.COM](https://demo.streamdal.com)

_The demo will showcase:_

1. **Tail**
    * Select any Component and start `Tail` request to watch live output
2. **Welcome Service/Emailer**
    * View how attached `Mask dot com emails` pipeline obfuscates `recipient` field if field contains `.com`
3. **Signup Service/Recorder**
    * Observe attached `Scrub ICMP` pipeline changing `object.ipv4_address` if `object.protocol` equals "ICMP"
4. **Observe Throughput**
    * Watch the read/write-per-second throughput for any component
5. **Data Graph**
    * Use the service map to see all services, operations and components and how they relate to each other
    * The [data graph](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/resources-support/glossary/#data-graph) is the "node map" of all services and components
6. **Schema Inference**
    * View the inferred JSON Schema for all consumers and producers 

**Each one of these actions is occurring in _real-time_!**

<sub>_You can read more about how this is achieved in the ["how does it work?"](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/getting-started/how-streamdal-works/) docs._</sub>

# Getting Started

Getting started consists of two steps:

1. **Installing** the server, console and their dependencies
2. **Instrumenting** your code with one of our [SDKs](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/core-components/sdk/)

### Install

The _easiest_ way to get Streamdal running is via `curl | bash`:

```
curl -sSL https://sh.streamdal.com | bash
```

1. The install script will verify that you have `git`, `docker` and `docker-compose` installed
2. The install script will clone this repo to `~/streamdal`
3. The install script will bring up all components via `docker-compose`

Once done:

ðŸŽ‰ **Open`http://localhost:8080` in your browser!** ðŸŽ‰

You should be presented with a _beautiful_ (but empty) UI! To populate it,
we will need to instrument some code. _Onto the next section!_

<sub>_For alternative installation methods, check the [install](./install) dir._</sub>

### Instrument

Once you've installed the server and console, you can instrument your code using
one of our [SDKs](#sdks).

> To see an example of a _complete_ instrumentation, take a look at the
[Go demo client](https://github.com/streamdal/server/tree/main/test-utils/demo-client) 
> that is bundled with the [server](https://github.com/streamdal/server).

**[Go](https://github.com/streamdal/go-sdk)**
```go
package main

import (
   "context"

   "github.com/streamdal/go-sdk"
)

func main() {
   sc, _ := streamdal.New(&streamdal.Config{
      ServerURL:       "streamdal-server.svc.cluster.local:8082",
      ServerToken:     "1234",
      ServiceName:     "billing-svc",
      ShutdownCtx:     context.Background(),
   })

   resp, _ := sc.Process(context.Background(), &streamdal.ProcessRequest{
      OperationType: streamdal.OperationTypeConsumer,
      OperationName: "new-order-topic",
      ComponentName: "kafka",
      Data:          []byte(`{"object": {"field": true}}`),
   })
}
```

**[Python](https://github.com/streamdal/python-sdk)**
```python
from streamdal import (OPERATION_TYPE_CONSUMER, ProcessRequest, StreamdalClient, StreamdalConfig)

client = StreamdalClient(
   cfg=StreamdalConfig(
      service_name="order-ingest",
      streamdal_url="streamdal-server.svc.cluster.local:8082",
      streamdal_token="1234",
   )
)

res = client.process(
   ProcessRequest(
      operation_type=OPERATION_TYPE_CONSUMER,
      operation_name="new-order-topic",
      component_name="kafka",
      data=b'{"object": {"field": true}}',
   )
)
```

**[Node.js](https://github.com/streamdal/node-sdk)**
```typescript
import { OperationType, Streamdal } from "@streamdal/node-sdk";

export const example = async () => {
  const streamdal = new Streamdal({
    streamdalUrl: "localhost:8082",
    streamdalToken: "1234",
    serviceName: "test-service-name",
    pipelineTimeout: "100",
    stepTimeout: "10",
  });

  const result = await streamdal.processPipeline({
    audience: {
      serviceName: "test-service",
      componentName: "kafka",
      operationType: OperationType.PRODUCER,
      operationName: "kafka-producer",
    },
    data: new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify({ key: "value" })),
  });
};

```  

  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **These are _basic, minimal_ examples and should NOT be used in production code.**

# How Does It Work?

Streamdal consists of **three** main components:

- **[Server](https://github.com/streamdal/server)**
- **[Console](https://github.com/streamdal/console)**
- **[SDKs](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/core-components/sdk/)**

The basic flow is that you [install](#getting-started) the server and console and
wrap any reads or writes in your app with our SDK. Once that's done, you will be 
able to see the data your app is reading or writing in the 
[console](https://github.com/streamdal/console) (or use the [CLI](https://github.com/streamdal/cli)).

You will also be able to enforce rules on your data (such as _"this should be 
valid JSON"_, _"message should contain a field called `foo`"_, _"strip all email
addresses"_ and so on).
